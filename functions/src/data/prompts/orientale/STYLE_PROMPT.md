A mid-tempo Romanian oriental song performed by a male vocalist with expressive, seductive phrasing. The instrumental blends Arabic influences, featuring oud, oriental violin, nai, clarinet, accordion, darbuka, tambal, and bass. No guitar or modern electronic instruments. Tempo is moderate (85â€“100 BPM), with flowing melodies, rhythmic ornamentation, and sensual phrasing. Vocals use nasal tone, melodic slides, and vocal trills, inspired by traditional oriental singing. The mood is mysterious, emotional, and danceable, evoking the atmosphere of a luxurious oriental party or a passionate love story under the moonlight.
