Generate a high-energy Romanian manea de opulență designed to make the listener feel powerful and untouchable. The instrumental must hit hard: bold oriental synths, aggressive bass, fast-paced Balkan percussion, and flashy electronic accordion. Add a male vocal group or chorus yelling key phrases in unison for maximum impact. The lead vocals should sound dominant and confident, full of swagger and vocal flourishes. Lyrics must flex wealth, luxury, fame, and superiority. No chill, no sadness — just pure alpha energy from start to finish, made for blasting in expensive cars and clubs.
