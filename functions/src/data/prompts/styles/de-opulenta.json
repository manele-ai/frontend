    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian manea about wealth and luxury. The song should highlight themes such as expensive cars, designer clothes, gold, status, and living a high life. Use bold, confident expressions, simple rhymes, and bragging verses. Include a repetitive, powerful chorus that glorifies success and makes listeners feel powerful. Avoid vulgarity but emphasize dominance and admiration.",
    "style": "Create a song in the style of a flashy, high-class Romanian manea. The beat should be mid-tempo, smooth but rich, with layered oriental synths, trap-influenced basslines, and digital strings. The vocals should be smooth yet assertive, delivered with pride by a male or female singer. Add vocal flourishes that emphasize status and power. The production must feel expensive and glamorous, perfect for flashy Instagram stories, luxury parties, or club entrances."
