    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian party manea. Focus on themes like friends, dancing, drinks, joy, and unity. The lyrics should be festive, with easy rhymes and catchy expressions. Include a chorus that everyone at a party would sing out loud. No drama â€” just full-on fun and celebration.",
    "style": "Compose a high-energy manea designed for Romanian parties. The instrumentation should be upbeat and cheerful, with oriental synths, live-feel accordion, fast tempo beats, and claps. The vocals should be joyful and strong, encouraging dancing and toasting. The vibe must be vibrant and rhythmic, made to light up weddings, birthdays, and club nights."
