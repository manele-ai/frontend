    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian party manea. The song should focus on themes like friendship, celebration, flashy lifestyle, luxury, drinks, and respect. Use simple rhymes, repeated catchy phrases, and manea-style expression. Keep the tone festive, loyal, and uplifting. No profanity — just pure Balkan party energy. Include a repetitive, memorable chorus that people can easily sing along to.",
    "style": "Create a song in the style of a traditional Romanian manea de petrecere. The rhythm should be upbeat and catchy, featuring oriental synths, electronic accordion, Balkan-style claps, and sharp beats. The vocals must be performed by a passionate male singer with strong vocal embellishments, common in the manele genre. The mood should feel festive, full of charisma, and designed for dancing and dedication moments. There should be no instrumental-only sections — just constant vocals with classic manea structure. The song must unmistakably sound like a modern Romanian manea played at weddings, clubs, and parties."
