Compose a song blending Romanian popular music with manea. The arrangement should include traditional instruments like pan flute, accordion, and violin, mixed subtly with manea-style rhythm and bass. The tempo should be moderate and danceable. Vocals should be delivered clearly and respectfully, with a touch of folk singing style. The track should feel rooted in Romanian tradition but infused with modern manea groove, perfect for festivals, family events, or community celebrations.
