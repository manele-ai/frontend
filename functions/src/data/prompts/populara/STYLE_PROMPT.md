A lively, traditional Romanian folk dance song performed by a vocalist with cheerful, energetic phrasing. The melody is acoustic and upbeat (100–130 BPM), built for hora or sârba. The instrumentation includes violin, accordion, tambal, cobza, flute (caval), and tarabană. No guitar, no synths, no electronic elements. The rhythm is bouncy and repetitive, encouraging group dancing and clapping. Vocals use rural expressions and melodic ornaments typical to Romanian folklore. The mood is festive and rustic, echoing village celebrations, weddings, and community gatherings. The result should sound 100% traditional and dance-driven.
