A high-energy Romanian manea performed live, with authentic live-style instruments and vocals. Use traditional manea instruments: oriental violin, accordion, clarinet, tambal, saxophone, darbuka, bass. Instruments should sound raw and slightly imperfect, like recorded in a live event. No electronic synths or guitars. Include strong backing vocals that double main lines or add rhythmic inflexions like “ra tu pa tu pa”, “țac pac”, “opa!”, “haideee!”. Lead vocal is male, nasal and expressive, full of melismas, vibrato, glissando, and portamento—typical “floricele” used in manele live. Tempo is mid to upbeat (95–115 BPM). The vibe is loud, festive, interactive, and emotionally charged.
