Emotional Romanian manea performed by a male singer with raw, mournful expression. Instrumental must use traditional manea instruments: oriental violin, clarinet, saxophone, digital accordion, tarabană, light tambal, and deep bass. No guitar or modern pop elements. Tempo is slow (70–85 BPM), with dramatic pauses and subtle drops. The vocalist uses expressive “floricele” on voice: nasal tone, fast melismas, sob-like phrasing, emotional vibrato, imitating classic pain-singing. Minimal to no autotune. The mood is tragic, intimate, filled with longing, regret, and heartbreak. Pure emotion, no hype or party vibe.
