Generate a classic Romanian manea inspired by “Ți-am jurat iubire” by Florin Minune. Use oriental synths, electronic accordion, and Balkan-style percussion. The tempo should be mid-paced, emotional but danceable. Vocals must be passionate, dramatic, with strong melismas and heartfelt phrasing. Focus on themes of love, loyalty, and longing. No instrumental breaks — constant vocals in a classic manea structure, made for dedications and weddings.
