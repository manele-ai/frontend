Create a lively, traditional Romanian lăutărească party track for male vocals. Instrumentation should include virtuoso violin, shimmering cimbalom (țambal), rhythmic cobza or lute-like accompaniment, accordion, double bass, and occasional nai or clarinet, with no electronic or percussive drum kit.

Tempo should be upbeat and festive (medium‑fast, ca. 100‑120 bpm), with infectious groove suited for dancing and celebration. The ensemble plays richly ornamented melodies with improvisational flair, including expressive slides, trills, double‑stops, vibrant vibrato, and syncopated aksak‑style rhythms characteristic of urban tarafs.

The male singer delivers with warmth, charisma, and dynamic energy—clear melodic lines, emotional inflections, occasional vocal ornamentation, slight improvisation in phrasing. The performance should feel spontaneous yet refined, evoking communal joy, ritual, wedding festivity, and spirited interaction between singer and ensemble.
