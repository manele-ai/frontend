  "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a traditional Romanian lăutărească manea. The theme should revolve around love, respect, wisdom from life, and family values. Include classic manea metaphors, vivid village imagery, and poetic expressions. The structure should be storytelling-driven with a strong, emotional chorus. Use elegant, elevated language but keep it singable.",
  "style": "Create an authentic Romanian muzică lăutărească song, rooted in Gypsy (Roma) musical tradition. The instrumentation should feature live cimbalom, violin, accordion, and double bass, played with virtuosity and soul. The tempo can vary between slow and medium-paced, with rubato phrasing. Vocals must be performed by a male singer with expressive melismas, raw emotion, and traditional phrasing. The mood should be heartfelt and nostalgic, focusing on themes like fate, love, honor, and family. This is not pop — it's deeply rooted folklore with urban soul."
