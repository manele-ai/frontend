    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of an oriental-style Romanian manea. The theme can include passion, temptation, mystery, or seduction. Use exotic metaphors, bold romantic language, and mystical references. The chorus should be hypnotic, sensual, and easy to chant. Use simple, catchy rhymes with a dreamy tone.",
    "style": "Create a manea infused with oriental influences. The beat should be mid-tempo with Arabic-style percussion, melodic synths, and minor scale progressions. Add traditional eastern instruments like oud or ney (simulated electronically). The vocals should be sultry and fluid, male or female, with expressive melismas. The overall mood should be seductive, cinematic, and enchanting, ideal for nightclubs or exotic-themed parties."
