    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a manea inspired by Romanian popular music. Focus on village life, family, values, love, and traditional pride. Use respectful language, rural imagery, and cultural references. Keep rhymes folk-like, and the chorus should be heartfelt, familiar, and singable by all generations.",
    "style": "Compose a song blending Romanian popular music with manea. The arrangement should include traditional instruments like pan flute, accordion, and violin, mixed subtly with manea-style rhythm and bass. The tempo should be moderate and danceable. Vocals should be delivered clearly and respectfully, with a touch of folk singing style. The track should feel rooted in Romanian tradition but infused with modern manea groove, perfect for festivals, family events, or community celebrations."
