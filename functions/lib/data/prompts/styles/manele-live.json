    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a live Romanian manea. The theme can involve partying, dedications, love, or personal pride. Make sure to include lines that can be easily customized with names or cities for live performances. Use a call-and-response chorus, interactive lines, and celebratory phrases. Repeat catchy phrases that can hype up a crowd.",
    "style": "Create a high-energy manea tailored for live band performances. Use real instruments like accordion, keyboards, and traditional percussion, along with a backing band feel. Include space for improvisation and crowd engagement. The vocals should be loud, confident, and dynamic, with audience interactions (like shout-outs or name drops). The mood should be festive and intense, made for weddings, baptisms, or live concerts where dedications are a must."
