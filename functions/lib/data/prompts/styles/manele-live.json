    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a live Romanian manea. The theme can involve partying, dedications, love, or personal pride. Make sure to include lines that can be easily customized with names or cities for live performances. Use a call-and-response chorus, interactive lines, and celebratory phrases. Repeat catchy phrases that can hype up a crowd.",
    "style": "Create a live-style Romanian manea performance, as if recorded at a wedding or club with a full band. The track should include live claps, crowd ambiance, real accordion and keyboard riffs, and slightly imperfect but energetic vocals. The singer should engage the audience through vocal runs, name-drops, and party dedications. Keep the mix raw and authentic, not overproduced. The rhythm must be fast, celebratory, and infectious â€” this is made for dancing, dedications, and real-time emotion."
