    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a traditional Romanian lăutărească manea. The theme should revolve around love, respect, wisdom from life, and family values. Include classic manea metaphors, vivid village imagery, and poetic expressions. The structure should be storytelling-driven with a strong, emotional chorus. Use elegant, elevated language but keep it singable.",
    "style": "Compose a traditional lăutărească-style manea with acoustic instrumentation: accordion, cimbalom, violin, and upright bass. The rhythm should have a fluid Balkan groove, and the harmony should reflect old Romanian musical traditions. Vocals must be expressive and virtuosic, with folk-influenced ornamentation. The song should feel intimate, nostalgic, and rooted in authentic Romanian culture, perfect for dedications or cultural performances."
