    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian manea about sorrow and heartbreak. Focus on deep emotional pain, lost love, betrayal, and crying for someone who left. Use melancholic phrases, personal storytelling, and poetic sadness. Keep the rhymes heartfelt and expressive. The chorus should be tragic, easy to remember, and full of longing.",
    "style": "Create a slow, emotional manea in the style of 'de jale'. The instrumentation should include slow tempo beats, mournful clarinet or violin, soft keyboard pads, and gentle oriental percussion. The vocals should be deeply emotional, with expressive vibrato and melismas, performed by a male or female singer with dramatic intensity. The mood should be tearful, nostalgic, and suitable for late-night dedications or moments of reflection."
