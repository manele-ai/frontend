    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian manea about sorrow and heartbreak. Focus on deep emotional pain, lost love, betrayal, and crying for someone who left. Use melancholic phrases, personal storytelling, and poetic sadness. Keep the rhymes heartfelt and expressive. The chorus should be tragic, easy to remember, and full of longing.",
    "style": "Generate a classic Romanian manea inspired by “Ți-am jurat iubire” by Florin Minune. Use oriental synths, electronic accordion, and Balkan-style percussion. The tempo should be mid-paced, emotional but danceable. Vocals must be passionate, dramatic, with strong melismas and heartfelt phrasing. Focus on themes of love, loyalty, and longing. No instrumental breaks — constant vocals in a classic manea structure, made for dedications and weddings."
