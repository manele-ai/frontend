    "lyrics": "Write the lyrics of a Romanian manea about wealth and luxury. The song should highlight themes such as expensive cars, designer clothes, gold, status, and living a high life. Use bold, confident expressions, simple rhymes, and bragging verses. Include a repetitive, powerful chorus that glorifies success and makes listeners feel powerful. Avoid vulgarity but emphasize dominance and admiration.",
    "style": "Generate a high-energy Romanian manea de opulență designed to make the listener feel powerful and untouchable. The instrumental must hit hard: bold oriental synths, aggressive bass, fast-paced Balkan percussion, and flashy electronic accordion. Add a male vocal group or chorus yelling key phrases in unison for maximum impact. The lead vocals should sound dominant and confident, full of swagger and vocal flourishes. Lyrics must flex wealth, luxury, fame, and superiority. No chill, no sadness — just pure alpha energy from start to finish, made for blasting in expensive cars and clubs."
